Hey there!!!

People say nothing is impossible, but I do nothing every day.
I was born to make mistakes, not to fake perfection.
During the day, I don’t believe in ghosts. During the night, I become a bit more open-minded.
I wake up every morning with the joy and excitement of wanting to go directly back to sleep.
and
I’m not lazy. I’m just on energy saving mode!
